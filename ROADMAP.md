## 🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope

Don't add these (they bloat the product):

- Video conferencing (use Zoom/Teams)
- Learning content authoring (use existing tools)
- Proctoring services (privacy concerns)
- Social networking features (not a focus)
- Gamification (can feel forced)
- LTI integrations (adds complexity)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure if the LMS is working:

1. **Usage**: Daily active users, time spent
2. **Completion**: Assignment submission rate, late submission rate
3. **Grading**: Time to grade, feedback quality (length/AI usage)
4. **Satisfaction**: NPS from students and instructors
5. **Performance**: Page load times, error rates
